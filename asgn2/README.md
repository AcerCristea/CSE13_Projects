ASSIGNMENT 2: A Little Slice of π
==============================================

Preparation to Run the Code
---------------------------------
The first thing to do to successfully run this code is to download the asgn2 files from git, making sure you have the Makefile, mathlib.h file, mathlib-test.c and the c formula files into a folder/directory you can access while running the code.

Prior to running the code you MUST compile it using the command `make all` on your terminal. This compiles all of your code and gets it ready to be run.

Running the Code
-----------------------
These are the following options that can be used to run the certain functions:

` -a // Runs all tests. `

` -e // Runs e approximation test. `

` -b // Runs Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe π approximation test `

` -m // Runs Madhava π approximation test. `

` -r // Runs Euler sequence π approximation test. `

` -v // Runs Viète π approximation test. `

` -n // Runs Newton-Raphson square root approximation tests. `

` -s // Enable printing of statistics to see computed terms and factors for each tested function. `

` -h // Display a help message detailing program usage. `

This the following command to use to run the options listed above:

` ./mathlib-test -- // insert option here `
